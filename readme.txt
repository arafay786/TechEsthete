The amazing thing was the code was in indention format so that it was little easier to read.

The code was written in okay format, 
i prefer 
  to use camel-case-format for variable or any funtion name. 
  to give a space between block of code, give brackets in if or ifelse to read and debug things easily
  to use laravel itself AUTH user authentication. 
  to use elequant-model for databse crud opertations.

I would do it the way:
  to use own laravel authentication.
  give a required space in the variable string. 
  use elequant model for cruds operation or reagarding database.
  i use get() method to retrive data instead of all() with conditions as required.
